# Wordclock

## Code
This code is designed for the WeMos D1 Mini, but other ESP8266 will also work. Other controllers programmed using the Arduino-IDE
may also work with slight modification to the software.

In this repo you can find the two healthchecks and the clock's software.


### Healthchecks
The healthchecks are used to check if the hardware functions correctly before final assembly.

### Wordclock
This is the software that should be flashed after final assembly is finished.

#### Libraries
FastLED: http://fastled.io/ \
Arduino Time Library: https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/Time \
Arduino standard library: stdlib.h \
StringSplitter: https://github.com/aharshac/StringSplitter - The limit on output values needs to be increased to at least six

## CNC-Files
The files used by the CNC-Machine are also in here.
