# Wordclock

## Code

This code is designed for the WeMos D1 Mini, but other ESP8266 will also work. Other controllers programmed using the Arduino-IDE
may also work with slight modification to the software.

In this repo you can find the two healthchecks and the clock's software.
### Healthcheks

The healthchecks are used to check if the hardware functions correctly before final assembly.

### wordclock

This is the software that should be flashed after final assembly is finished.

## CNC-Files

The files used by the CNC-Machine are also in here.
